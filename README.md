# Rails Tutorial translation

This repository contains the HTML source for the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial, 2nd edition](http://railstutorial.org/), with the goal of allowing translation of the tutorial to other languages. 

## Getting started

To translate the tutorial, simply fork the repository, clone it to your local machine, and get started in your language of choice. Add additional translators as collaborators on GitHub as needed. At any time, you are free to deploy the result to a URL of your choice. Once it's up, send the URL to admin@railstutorial.org and I'll link to it from the main Rails Tutorial website.

*Add stuff about using the files and CSS*

Since I often make minor fixes to the book, I recommend occasionally merging in changes from the master branch. If merging causes too many conflicts, you can omit this optional step.
